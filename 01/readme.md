# JS-Atomic 01: Phone Number Auto-Tab Fields

## Description

JavaScript can create less work for an application's user. In this atomic, you will work with automatically moving the user's cursor to the next field in an HTML form.

## Tasks

Write code that accomplishes the following:

1. The user sees an HTML form, which has three separate fields for parts of a phone number (ex: 402-555-0000)

2. Write JavaScript so that when a user puts in the maximum number of characters (`maxlength`) of an input field, their cursor automatically moves to the next field.


## Questions

Once you're done with the JavaScript tasks, answer these questions in the body of your HTML file (formatted however makes the most sense -- maybe similar to how you've been doing it for previous atomics):

1. 
2.
